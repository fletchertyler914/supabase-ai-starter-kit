# Supabase Starter Kit - PRD

## Project Purpose

A production-ready Supabase starter kit that developers and AI agents can clone and immediately start building on. This eliminates the typical 1-2 weeks of backend setup and gets you straight to building features.

## What This Starter Kit Provides

### Ready-to-Run Stack
- **Supabase Database** - PostgreSQL with all the extensions configured
- **Authentication** - User signup/login working out of the box
- **API Layer** - REST and GraphQL endpoints auto-generated
- **Real-time** - WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Storage** - File uploads and CDN ready
- **Edge Functions** - Serverless functions for custom logic
- **Workflows** - n8n integration for background jobs

### Development Ready
- **Docker Setup** - Everything runs with `docker-compose up`
- **Local Development** - Hot reloading and development tools
- **Environment Management** - Proper env var handling
- **Database Scripts** - All the SQL setup files organized

## Current State (What Exists)

### Database Layer ✅
- `roles.sql` - User roles and permissions
- `jwt.sql` - JWT token configuration  
- `realtime.sql` - Real-time subscriptions
- `vector.sql` - Vector database for AI/search
- `webhooks.sql` - Webhook system
- `logs.sql` - Logging infrastructure
- `pooler.sql` - Connection pooling setup

### Infrastructure ✅  
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main services
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development config
- `docker-compose.s3.yml` - Storage setup
- `volumes/` - All the configuration files
- `reset.sh` - Reset script for development

### Functions ✅
- `hello/` - Basic function example
- `main/` - Primary business logic handler

### Workflows ✅
- n8n demo workflows and credentials ready to go

## What Needs Work

### Core Functionality
1. **Verify Docker Stack Works** - Make sure all services start and talk to each other
2. **Database Scripts Integration** - Ensure all SQL files work together properly
3. **Authentication Flow** - Configure Supabase auth with basic providers
4. **API Gateway** - Get Kong working with proper routing
5. **Edge Functions** - Make sure functions deploy and run correctly

### Developer Experience  
1. **Environment Setup** - Clean up env var management
2. **Database Initialization** - Automated setup on first run
3. **Basic Monitoring** - Health checks so you know if things are broken
4. **Error Handling** - Proper error responses instead of crashes

### Production Readiness
1. **Security Basics** - SSL, secrets management, basic hardening
2. **Performance** - Connection pooling working, basic caching
3. **Backup Strategy** - Simple database backup solution

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- `docker-compose up` gets everything running in under 5 minutes
- Database, API, auth, and functions all work together
- Can handle basic CRUD operations and file uploads
- Real-time features work for live updates

### Usability  
- AI agents can extend this without breaking existing functionality
- Clear separation between core infrastructure and custom code
- New features can be added without touching the base setup

## What This Starter Kit Doesn't Need

### Not Required
- Complex CI/CD pipelines
- Comprehensive documentation  
- Multi-region deployment
- Advanced monitoring/alerting
- Enterprise features
- Performance optimization beyond basics
- Extensive testing frameworks

### Out of Scope
- Custom UI components
- Business-specific features
- Advanced security compliance
- Scaling beyond single-instance
- Complex workflow orchestration

## Technical Approach

### Keep It Simple
- Use default configurations where possible
- Minimal custom code in the infrastructure layer
- Standard Docker patterns
- Basic security without over-engineering

### AI Agent Friendly
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular architecture
- Standard file organization
- Minimal dependencies between components

## Risk Management

### Main Risks
- **Docker complexity** - Keep configurations simple and well-commented
- **Service integration** - Test that all services actually work together
- **Database setup** - Ensure SQL scripts don't conflict with each other
- **Environment variables** - Clear documentation of what's required

### Mitigation
- Test the full stack regularly
- Keep configurations as standard as possible
- Document any non-obvious setup steps
- Provide working examples for each major feature
