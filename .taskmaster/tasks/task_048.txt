# Task ID: 48
# Title: Verify Docker Stack Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure all Docker services start correctly and communicate with each other properly.
# Details:
1. Review and validate the existing Docker configuration files:
   - docker-compose.yml (main services)
   - docker-compose.dev.yml (development config)
   - docker-compose.s3.yml (storage setup)

2. Test the complete stack startup with:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Verify service connectivity:
   - Supabase database is accessible
   - Authentication service is running
   - API endpoints are generated
   - WebSocket connections work
   - Storage service is operational
   - Edge functions can be invoked
   - n8n workflows are accessible

4. Implement health check endpoints for each service

5. Document any configuration adjustments needed

6. Ensure services start in the correct order with proper dependency chains

# Test Strategy:
1. Create a test script that verifies each service is running with proper status codes
2. Test inter-service communication with basic requests
3. Verify logs show successful startup without errors
4. Measure startup time to ensure it meets the 5-minute requirement
5. Test stack restart to ensure persistence works correctly
